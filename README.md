# about-my-projects
A little information about my projects uploaded to github.

This github page was made initially to publish my school- and freetime coding projects. What this means is that the projects are mostly in Finnish, from file names all the way to parameter names. So it can be a little difficult for an English viewer to understand the projects.

All of my project consists of a readme file which briefly summarizes what I learned from that project and what I was supposed to learn.
